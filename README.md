# PagingService
A service written in Luau for efficiently saving data to Roblox's DataStores

Paging Service is a comprehensive system allowing developers to create "Pages" to
read from and write data to. It comes with support for accessing "Pages" across
multiple servers, along with support for users to use default compression algorithms
or implement their own. The service seamlessly handles updates to "Pages" made across
different servers and contains an advanced system to handle and save Pages that go
over the 4MB DataStore limit for Roblox.

# HOW TO USE
You can either download the _.rbxm_ file, which is a roblox model file. Do this by right clicking on the explorer in studio and selecting **Insert From File**.
**ALTERNATIVELY**, you can download the _.rbxl_ file, which is a roblox place file. You can directly open this if you have roblox studio installed.
