# PagingService
A service written in Luau for efficiently saving data to Roblox's DataStores

Paging Service is a comprehensive system allowing developers to create "Pages" to
read from and write data to. It comes with support for accessing "Pages" across
multiple servers, along with support for users to use default compression algorithms
or implement their own. The service seamlessly handles updates to "Pages" made across
different servers and contains an advanced system to handle and save Pages that go
over the 4MB DataStore limit for Roblox.
